# How to create an NPM package like this

### Set up a new project
Create a new project directory for your NPM package and navigate into it:
```sh
mkdir vsp-bot
cd vsp-bot
```
### Initialize NPM
Initialize NPM in the project directory by running the following command and providing the required information when prompted:
```sh
npm init
```
This will create a package.json file that will store metadata about your package.
### Write the code
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., index.js) that contains the functionality you want your NPM package to provide. For this example, let's create a simple function that returns an object with details about VSP:
```sh
// index.js
const biodata = {
  name: "VSP Bot",
  creator: "Vishnu Suresh Perumbavoor",
  founderOf: "VSP dot AI",
  createdOn: "28 April 2023",
};

module.exports = biodata;
```

### Test the code 
Create a test file (e.g., test.js) to ensure that your code is working correctly:
```sh
// test.js
const vspbot = require('./index');

console.log(vspbot);
```
Run the test to see if everything is working as expected:
```sh
node test.js
```
### Add additional files (optional)
You may want to include additional files, like a LICENSE file, a README.md file, or other documentation.

### Publish the package
To publish the package to the NPM registry, you need an NPM account. If you don't have one, create one on the NPM website.

Once you have an account, log in to NPM from your terminal:
```sh
npm login
```
Provide your NPM username, password, and email when prompted.

Finally, publish the package to the NPM registry:

```sh
npm publish
```
Your NPM package, vsp-bot, is now published and can be installed by other developers using npm install vsp-bot.

### Updating the package (optional)

If you need to make updates to the package in the future, you can follow these steps:

* Make the desired changes to the code in index.js.
* Update the version number in package.json.
* Publish the updated package using npm publish.

That's it! You have now created and published your own NPM package. Other developers can now use your package in their projects by installing it via NPM. Remember that you can always improve and expand the package functionality based on your needs and community feedback. Happy coding!
